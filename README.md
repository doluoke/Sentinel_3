# Sentinel_3
Sentinel-3 Toolkit_Script

This software was developed by Chi-Hung Chang, Modurodoluwa Okeowo and Hyongki Lee (PhD) at the University of Houston, Texas.

This algorithm was developed to automate the process of generating Sentinel-3 altimetry time series plot directly from the raw files.

Supported by: NASA SERVIR & Applied Sciences Program
